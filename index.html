    <h2>Career Profile</h2>
    <p>
      Biomedical sciences graduate with 1 year communications and events management experience for a
      small charity. Proven record of accomplishment in increasing member involvement in the
      organisation, particularly in events and through the website, an area in which I surpassed
      expectations. Strong written communication skills demonstrated through re-writing and
      publishing a guide book that sold in record time (13,000 copies in 7 months). I am looking to
      move to London with my partner, and further develop my skills in event management.
