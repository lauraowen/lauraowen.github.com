### Current Employment
#### Information Officer, National Governors’ Association (September 2011 – present)
As Information Officer at the NGA, my role varies between communication with
members; marketing and promotion; and helping to run events. Shortly after
starting at the NGA, a new website was launched. I manage the content of this
website to ensure it is up to date and easily accessible. After receiving basic
training on the CMS (Kentico based system), I very quickly became the resident
expert, and have since received further advanced training. This has increased my
ability to try out new innovative ideas, to both increase readership, and give
members better value for money. To help understand how the website works, I have
taught myself basic HTML and CSS using online tutorials.

I am the editor of a weekly newsletter sent to 20,000 members, and responsible
for updating guidance that we provide online. I was responsible for upgrading
the system to use MailChimp to improve both the quality and the speed of sending
20,000 emails. When trying new ideas, I use Google Analytics to see how they
affect the readership of the website.

I took the initiative to research a new membership database after hearing of
lots of problems from colleagues. I drew up a report detailing the issues after
conversations with them, and I am now in the final stages of commissioning the
new software.
